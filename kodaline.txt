"All I Want"
All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man I'm sure

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

But if you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Oh oh

So you brought out the best of me
A part of me I've never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But if you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody

Oh

If you loved me
Why'd you leave me?
Take my body
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody like you

Oh

"Wherever You Are"

You say you love me
You say you care
And when you're with me
My future's there

We get carried away in emotions
We get lost in each other's eyes
And we forget what we regret
As we cast our fears aside

When the world's getting hard
I will go to wherever you are
Running blind in the dark
I will go to wherever you are

Wherever you are
That's where I'll be
Wherever you are
That's where I'll be

Forget the violence
Forget the world
I see you smiling
I'm lost for words

We get carried away in emotion
We get lost in each other's eyes
And we forget what we regret
As we cast our fears aside

When the world's getting hard
I will go to wherever you are
Running blind in the dark
I will go to wherever you are

Wherever you are
That's where I'll be
Wherever you are
That's where I'll be

That's where I'll be
I swear I'll be

When the world's getting hard
I will go to wherever you are
Running blind in the dark
I will go to wherever you are

Wherever you are
That's where I'll be
Wherever you are
That's where I'll be

"Sometimes"

I'm not looking for an answer, I just hope these words will help
Whoever's listening, if someone cares to listen in
I've been up and down in life, sure, every day's a chance to fight
Forever wrestling, trying to make amends again

But I break down and I lose control
The band don't care 'cause they had a good show
I won't cry 'cause I'm lucky I know
A restless heart and a beautiful soul
It really doesn't matter if I stay or go
It's hitting me hard but I'm lucky I know

All of my friends
Don't understand
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm blind
Maybe we all get lost sometimes
Sometimes

(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)

And every night when I'm alone I put another podcast on
It helps me slip away, keeps me learning everyday
Reading books on meditation fights away the hesitations
Hanging over me, easing the anxiety

But I break down and I lose control
The band don't care 'cause they had a good show
I won't cry 'cause I'm lucky I know
A restless heart and a beautiful soul
It really doesn't matter if I stay or go
It's hitting me hard but I'm lucky I know

All of my friends
Don't understand
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm blind
Maybe we all get lost sometimes
Sometimes

(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe we all get lost sometimes (Oh, oh, oh)

But I break down and I lose control
The band don't care 'cause they had a good show
I won't cry 'cause I'm lucky I know
'Cause I'm lucky I know
A restless heart and a beautiful soul
It really doesn't matter if I stay or go
It's hitting me hard but I'm taking it slow

All of my friends
Don't understand
Maybe I'm crazy
Going outta my mind
Maybe we all get lost sometimes
Sometimes

(Oh, oh, oh)
But I break down and I lose control
The band don't care 'cause they had a good show
(Oh, oh, oh)
I won't cry 'cause I'm lucky I know
'Cause I'm lucky I know
(Oh, oh, oh)
A restless heart and a beautiful soul
It really doesn't matter if I stay or go
(Oh, oh, oh)
It's hitting me hard but I'm taking it slow
All get lost sometimes

I'm not looking for an answer, I just hope these words will help
Whoever's listening, if someone cares to listen in

"Saving Grace"

When you're out in the open
And you're tired of hoping
I'll be there in a moment
I'll be by your side
When you're scared and you're lonely
When there's no one to hold you
I just want you to know that
I'll be by your side

You keep me strong when I can't carry on

When you lose your feet, fall down to your knees and your heart's about to break
I will be your saving grace
When your eyes can't see, take my eyes from me
When you're lost and losing faith
I will be your saving grace

Be my, be my, be my saving grace
Won't you be my, be my, be my saving grace

When my heart's getting older
And my body is breaking down
In my head yeah I know that I'll be by your side
I don't know about the future
No one knows what the future holds
All I know is I know that I'm giving you my life

You keep me strong when I can't carry on

When you lose your feet, fall down to your knees and your heart's about to break
I will be your saving grace
When your eyes can't see, take my eyes from me
When you're lost and losing faith
I will be your saving grace

You keep me strong when I can't carry on

When you lose your feet, fall down to your knees and your heart's about to break
I will be your saving grace
When your eyes can't see, take my eyes from me
When you're lost and losing faith
I will be your saving grace

Be my, be my, be my saving grace
Won't you be my, be my, be my saving grace

"Say Something"

I was scared, I was unprepared
I was not aware you were caught in a bubble
You and I had a drunken fight
On a Tuesday night downtown

Well it cuts so deep when you try to speak
But the words don't come out right
You can lean on me when it's hard to breathe
You can call me anytime

So please
Say something to me
I'm down on my knees
Say something to me, say something
Say something to me

I would walk for ya, I would climb
Just to keep you safe and to keep you of trouble
I'd do time for you, I would lie for you
I would die for you

Well it cuts so deep when you try to speak
But the words don't come out right
You can lean on me when it's hard to breathe
You can call me anytime

So please
Say something to me
I'm down on my knees
Say something to me, say something
Say something to me

Well it cuts so deep when you try to speak
But the words don't come out right
You can lean on me when it's hard to breathe
You can call me anytime

So please
Say something to me
I'm down on my knees
Say something to me, say something
Say something to me

Say something to me

"The Evening"

We lifted our sails up
And went with the wind
Tonight I miss you
It's hard to begin

We'd hide in my attic
And paint on the walls
I'll never forget that
I remember it all

I wish you could be here
Just for the evening
I wish you could be here
To see what I'm seeing
'Cause we were just kids
And now I'm all grown up
Walking on water
But the seas got rough
I wish you could be here
Just for the evening
Just for the evening

We'd go to a party
We'd poison our blood
Stay out after dark, we'd
Get lost in the woods

Last night I was sleeping
And I had a dream
That you were still breathing
And living like me

I wish you could be here
Just for the evening
I wish you could be here
To see what I'm seeing
'Cause we were just kids
And now I'm all grown up
Walking on water
But the seas got rough
I wish you could be here
Just for the evening
Just for the evening

I wish you could be here
Just for the evening

I wish you could be here (I wish you could be here)
Just for the evening (Just for the evening)
I wish you could be here (I wish you could be here)
To see what I'm seeing (To see what I'm seeing)
'Cause we were just kids
And now I'm all grown up
Walking on water
But the seas got rough
I wish you could be here (I wish you could be here)
Just for the evening (Just for the evening)
Just for the evening

Just for the evening
I wish you could be here
I wish you could be here

"Everyone Changes"

They say that the hardest thing to do is say goodbye
They say it's the hardest thing
We tried to stitch it up and now I wonder why
Why is this happening to me?

But it wasn't right, had another fight
We were young but we never quite took flight
In another life maybe you and I
Would be walking down the aisle dressed in white

I can see that all you need is everything I'll never be
But everyone changes, everyone changes
Say goodbye and let it be, I thought you were the one for me
But everyone changes, everyone changes

You say you left everything behind all because of me
But I gave you everything
Dreaming of futures with a child and a family
Did they ever mean a thing to you?

But it wasn't right, had another fight
We were young but we never quite took flight
In another life maybe you and I
Would be walking down the aisle dressed in white

I can see that all you need is everything I'll never be
But everyone changes, everyone changes
Say goodbye and let it be, I thought you were the one for me
But everyone changes, everyone changes

But it wasn't right, had another fight
We were young but we never quite took flight
In another life maybe you and I
Would be walking down the aisle dressed in white

I can see that all you need is everything I'll never be
But everyone changes, everyone changes
Say goodbye and let it be, I thought you were the one for me
But everyone changes, everyone changes

"In The End"

I was blinded by the power
Climbing up the ladder
Even pushed away my father
I was caught up in the rat race
Living in a dark place
Man, I wish I never bothered

In the end when all is said and done
In the end we learn to overcome
In the end we'll sing our final song
We forgive, we forget and move on

I was standing there in silence
In a church somewhere in Ireland
It was there I was reminded
The mistakes that I collected
And the people I affected
They're the ones that I respected

In the end when all is said and done
In the end we learn to overcome
In the end we'll sing our final song
We forgive, we forget and move on

And move on
And move on

We forgive, we forget and move on

"Shed A Tear"

It's harder to see through the eyes of a stranger
It's easier to love when the world doesn't hate you
When you try to sing out but nobody hears a word
It's safer to swim when the tide's not against you

Yeah-yeah
(You've been here before)
I know you've been here before
(Never letting go)
And giving up is letting go
(Never fight alone)
But you don't have to fight alone

I shed a tear for you
Open your eyes, I'm by your side
I'm never leaving you
Darkness to light, stay through the night
I'm walking in your shoes
So you know that it's the truth
When nobody's here for you
Let me make it clear
That I shed a, I shed a tear
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear
Shed a tear, shed a tear)

And I feel your pain when I know you're in trouble
And I'll take the blame from your hurt in your struggle
And when you tryna speak out but nobody hears a word
I'll be your voice, lay your head on my shoulder

Oh (You've been here before)
I know you've been here before
(Never letting go)
And nothing is impossible
(Never fight alone)
You don't have to fight alone

I shed a tear for you
Open your eyes, I'm by your side
I'm never leavin' you
Darkness to light, stay through the night
I'm walkin' in your shoes
So you know that it's the truth
When nobody's here for you
Let me make it clear
